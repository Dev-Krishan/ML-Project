Heart prediction system
In  this project we created an algorithm to predcit heart disease or not. 
We performed EDA to get insights from data.
Then perform classification and then tuning hyperparameters to get model.
and then evaluated model on certain parameters such as ROC curve, accuracy, precision, etc.
